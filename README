Add cloudlab to ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile (pick first one that exists already). Note that a default installation of OSX will not create a bash profile, in which case you must create one manually:

export CLOUDLAB_INSTALL_ROOT=~/cloudlab
export PATH="$CLOUDLAB_INSTALL_ROOT/bin:$PATH"

Open a new Terminal window or force current window to reload file you just changed:
> source ~/.bash_profile

Get the cloudlab repo.  Donâ€™t clone it into CLOUDLAB_INSTALL_ROOT
> git clone git@github.com:floored/cloudlab.git

Build the dependencies. This will take <1 hours and you will see warning messages. From cloudlab root:
> make
