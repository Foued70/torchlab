1. Brew install Octave
2. In this directory, there should be an optim directory,
3. Run octave, and addpath([optim directory path]);
4. To calibrate the camera, copy full resolution checkerboard 
    calibration images into calibration directory
5. Make sure the images have the same base name and are numbered 
    consecutively.
    Example:    Calib007.jpg, Calib008.jpg, Calib009.jpg, 
                Calib010.jpg, Calib011.jpg, Calib012.jpg
6. Run FLOORED_ocam_calib, and follow the prompts. Ignore any 
    warnings.
7. The calibrated parameters should be stored in ocam_model_orig
8. Relevant members of ocam_model_orig:
    r2t - polynomial coefficient mapping from rho, the pixel 
            radius from the "center" to theta, the real-world 
            angle of the z axis (axis orthogonal to image plane)
    t2r - polynomial coefficient mapping from theta to rho.
    xc, yc - pixel coordinates for the center.
    height, width - pixel height and width of calibration images
9. As a sanity check, use FLOORED_undistort_image to undistort 
    image and see if calibration was sane. Use jpg files and 
    pass in the name without file extension. For example, 
    FLOORED_undistort_image('Calib007', ocam_model_orig, 1000, 2000); 
    will undistort Calib007.jpg and save the undistorted image as 
    a 1000h x 2000w jpg file.
