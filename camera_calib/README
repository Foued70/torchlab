INSTALL

 +  Install octave.  on OSX: 
    brew install octave
 +  You need to compile the autoCornerFinder executable.
    FIXME make this cleaner.
   - cd autoCornerFinder 
   - edit Makefile line for the CLOUDLABLIBPATH and
     CLOUDLABINCLUDEPATH for you installation. 
   - type make
   - make a sym link to CLOUDLABLIBPATH in autoCornerFinder: 
     ln -s ~/Users/marco/local/lib 
   - FIXME figure out the annoying dynamic linking on OSX so that the
     full pathnames for opencv are added to the executable

RUN

1. cd calibration (octave searches local path for code)
2. start octave: octave

3. addpath("/Users/<you>/<cloudlabpath>/camera_calib/optim") . you
   need the absolute path to the optim/ directory.

4. To calibrate the camera, copy full resolution checkerboard
    calibration images into calibration directory

5. Make sure the images have the same base name and are numbered
    consecutively.
    Example:    Calib007.jpg, Calib008.jpg, Calib009.jpg,
                Calib010.jpg, Calib011.jpg, Calib012.jpg

6. Run FLOORED_ocam_calib, and follow the prompts. Ignore any
    warnings. All defaults are fine except the checkerboard pattern
    should be 7 horizontal and 5 vertical.

7. The calibrated parameters should be stored in ocam_model_orig and
saved to ocam_model.txt.  You can copy the relevant parameters to the
cloudlab code src/util/lens_sensor_type.lua

8. Relevant members of ocam_model_orig:
    r2t - polynomial coefficient mapping from rho, the pixel 
            radius from the "center" to theta, the real-world 
            angle of the z axis (axis orthogonal to image plane)
    t2r - polynomial coefficient mapping from theta to rho.
    xc, yc - pixel coordinates for the center.
    height, width - pixel height and width of calibration images

9. As a sanity check, use FLOORED_undistort_image to undistort 
    image and see if calibration was sane. Use jpg files and 
    pass in the name without file extension. For example, 
    FLOORED_undistort_image('Calib007', ocam_model_orig, 1000, 2000); 
    will undistort Calib007.jpg and save the undistorted image as 
    a 1000h x 2000w jpg file.
